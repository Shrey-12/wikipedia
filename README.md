# wikipedia
Create a Wikipedia clone like Vue app, which accepts a heading or topic from the user, and shows the information about the same by making an API call to the Wikipedia API.  Firstly, the app can show some initial content, say 200-300 characters or so, and provides an "Expand" button, clicking on which, all the fetched content can be shown.
